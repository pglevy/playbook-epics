# About this project
By instituting the trappings of Agile without shifting the mindset of the whole team to embrace the underlying principles of *focusing on customer value* and *delivering a working product iteratively*, government projects will continue to take too long, cost too much, and fail to meet the needs of the people they’re trying help. The [U.S. Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/) is a collection of principles, prompts, and action items aimed at improving the creation and delivery of government services. This playbook can be used as a framework to organize projects and work in a way that helps instill this mindset of delivering value to customers. By thinking of the [plays as epics](#think-of-the-plays-as-epics) and our [teammates as customers](#think-of-your-team-as-customers-in-the-early-stages) in the early stages of a project, we can begin to [build our shipping muscles](#build-your-shipping-muscles) in a way that increases the performance of the team and the success of the project.

# Mindsets

## Think of the plays as epics

When you think about an epic as a segment of work that provides discrete value, the plays themselves are a perfect organizing structure for the early part of a project. For example, the epic Understand What People Need (Play 1 from the Playbook) can include stories relating to writing a research plan, writing a working agreement, compiling technical questions/assumptions, and starting on brand exploration.

## Think of your team as “customers” in the early stages

Everyone agrees in theory that the goal of Agile is to deliver value to the end customer/user. But what I’ve found is the beginning of a project is often a period of ambiguity and increasing anxiety as project managers and developers nervously await wireframes from UX designers. Instead of arbitrarily assigning tasks that will sit on a Jira board for weeks while the design team is “doing discovery,” break down the work the whole team is doing at this time and who it’s for. For example, “The whole team needs to understand expectations for initial research.”

## Build your shipping muscles

When a project begins with the team members focused on the “tasks I need to do” as opposed to thinking about “the team needs this artifact for this purpose,” it’s hard to make the mental shift when product decisions are made and you start building for the external customer. By starting to focus on working together to deliver value for others early — and holding each other accountable for finishing and “shipping” stories on time — this mindset can more easily carry through to actual product development.
