# The whole team needs a summary of findings and insights to confidently move forward with design and development

## Description

While learning and understand will continue to develop throughout the project, a synthesis of the initial research will provide the whole team, including stakeholders, a shared understanding of our working assumptions based on research and plan for moving forward.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Recap of research done
- Synthesis of findings across all research activities
- Insights to guide design and development on next steps
    - Note: Insights are “assertions of truth,” not necessarily specific recommendations for what to build
- Share with Client Product Owner and post on Teams wiki
