# The whole team needs to have a plan for an MVP release within 3 months

## Description

As referred to in the Play 4 checklist: Ship a functioning “minimum viable product” (MVP) that solves a core user need as soon as possible, no longer than three months from the beginning of the project, using a “beta” or “test” period if needed.

In addition to documenting the specific features, we may also document things like:

- Assumptions and questions
- Goals for learning

## Acceptance Criteria

- Scope of MVP defined
- Roadmap created showing MVP scope and what comes next
- Shared with team and posted on wiki
