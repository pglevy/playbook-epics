# The whole team needs a working agreement

## Description

The team needs to collaboratively agree on a Definition of Done: what it means for a story, an epic, and releases to be considered “done.”

This may include things like the following, but can be further refined:

- Non-functional requirements (performance, accessibility, responsiveness)
- Test coverage
- Code reviews
- Design reviews
- QA
- Product Owner sign-off

## Acceptance Criteria

- Draft created and posted to Teams wiki
- Agreed to by whole team
