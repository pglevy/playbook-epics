# The whole team needs to collaborate on building out the initial backlog

## Description

To ensure we’re looking at the project holistically and benefitting from everyone’s input, we should hold a story mapping session (or similar activity) to collaboratively define our initial understanding of the work that needs to be done to meet the goals of the project.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Initial research is shared with the team
- High-lever journey map defined (for multiple audiences as needed)
- Collaborative workshop conducted to gather team’s input on work to be done
- Epics and stories (along with descriptions and acceptance criteria) added to Jira
- The output of the session is shared on the Teams wiki
